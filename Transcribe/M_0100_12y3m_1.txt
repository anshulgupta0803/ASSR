South Park, the Simpsons, Friends, Eastenders, and, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. And MY favourite hobbies are skating, WHAT I mean by skating is ramps and, things like that. And I play football, skateboarding, cricket, hockey, swimming, basketball, and a lot of other sports. I have got a playstation, and I've got five games. Spiro The Dragon, Heart Of Darkness, Tackle Two Touring Cars, OddWorld Abe's Exodus, and Cool Boarder Three. I have a pet dog, called Buddy, and two pet goldfish called jaws and Flannel, or something like that, I can't remember. Erm. I HAVE A large bedroom, WITH a hi-fi, a drum kit, and I play the viola, and drums as well. I used to play the piano, grade one, and then I stopped after grade one, because IT WAS getting a bit tedious.I HAVE a bike.
