when i went to JAPAN last november  DAY on my first day there i got lost for nine hours FINDING my youth hostel place that  so i didn't sleep for UM TWO FOR twenty three hours the most DIFFICULT part is reading the train system it is because they have it in their chinese writing there and sometimes in IN ROMAN LETTERS and plus you have to ask them things like WHAT STATION is this in Japanese sometimes EVERYONE well almost everyone there spoke speak english a bit been LOOKING  for airport work like  the immigration bit or WHEN THEY SPEAK  to the foreign TRAVLERS  come  to ENGLAND  I was thinking  about doing that and asking things like MONEY THEY earn from it and for VARIOUS things also the airport job as a baggage as a baggage handler as well
