 well i suppose MY current big story is i spent two weeks over the summer holiday living on an airfield in nottinghamshire learning to skydive yeah it was WAS fantastic actually  was there for two weeks first week was  well bad because the weather just horrific  got only two jumps in that entire time and then second week i was there i got eighteen in and  i was JUMPING my ass off really it was the all the other lucky thing was i happened to be there during whats kinda known as a boogie which is a like a week long kind of skydiving festival so there were people from all over the world there and kind of loads of aircrafts constant jumping it was just amazing experience really how long's that is that two minutes okay fine so yeah so thats that and now i'm jumping with ucl's skydive club because it happens kings doesn't have one i'm now at king's college which is nice i'm living near waterloo station and so kind of my walk to work takes me over the thames everyday which is always nice even when the weather is appalling as it has been yeah IT'S it's all good really  sharing a flat with five others and kinda living the student life really it's absolutely fantastic  what else really my course I'M STUDYING  i'm studying war studies and history which is war studies is one of kings' PET pet departments really it's  very odd and always raises eyebrows whenever i tell people it's very interesting and we're all going to the national army museum tomorrow actually it's just you know cough the course really day off it's i've RUN run out of things to say i think it's well its exactly what it says on the tin really it's the study of war its kind of an understanding seeks to develop an understanding of war as a human phenomenon it's not just military history although history is a big thing it's politics philosophy sociology economics art its very broad its very interesting
